  <title>Golden Cheetah: Cycling Performance Software for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We are proud to announce that GoldenCheetah v3.2 was released today.</p>
<p>Version 3.2 contains lots of bug fixes and functional changes to support Running and Swimming, Interval discovery and analysis, Moxy and Vector support and many Training View enhancements.</p>
<p>We have moved to storing activity data in a native JSON format. This means data will be converted when imported but the originals are kept too (in case you need the original data for any reason). When you first run version 3.2 it will upgrade the athlete data. We therefore recommend you TAKE A BACKUP before you install and use Version 3.2.</p>
<p>It represents over 1,400 code changes made since the last release by a development team from all corners of the globe. Ale Martinez has been solely responsible for implementing support for running and swimming, Jörn Rischmueller has implemented Vector support and all the heavy lifting for the upgrade and native file format. Lastly, Damien Grauser has implemented the interval discovery and analysis features.</p>
