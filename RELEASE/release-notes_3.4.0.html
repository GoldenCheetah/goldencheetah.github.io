<p>We are proud to announce the release of version 3.4 of GoldenCheetah.</p>

<p>Over the last 12 months since the release of version 3.3 we have been focusing on adding functionality to enable users to perform more insightful analytics. This has 4 main elements; supporting more devices and data series, making the data model user extensible, providing user tools to build analytics and enabling better sharing of user content.</p>

<p>We still have more to do, but have pushed out version 3.4 now to get FIT 2.0 support out as quickly as possible since more devices and services are beginning to support FIT 2.0 and use its extensible data model.</p>
